# Collecting data on Wikipedia requests for adminship 

Requests for adminship are an important part of the Wikipedia community. There are several scientific studies trying to explain and predict voting behaviour within these requests. These tend to make use of the same dataset as it is difficult to obtain the election data.

This repo contains an example script for collecting election data in the German Wikipedia. For more information on how to collect RfA data and more information about how this script can well be improved, please see the learning pattern on Wikimedia here: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Learning_patterns/Collecting_data_on_requests_for_adminship
